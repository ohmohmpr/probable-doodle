# [What do Cameras Measure?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViCqs7J2yi0)

They measure light intensities and map those light onto the sensor. On sensor, they have many cells on itself. Therefore, those light will be map onto each cell. In conclusion, cameras map 3D object onto 2D plane.




# [Visual Feature Part 1: Computing Keypoints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGya59Je4Bs)
## 1. Key point: a point that is locally distinct in an image.
### 1.2 Finding those distinct points.
    What, How, Why?

    - We slide a filter around the image to compute the gradient. and They are Soble and Schar operator.
    
#### 1.2.1 Harris corners
#### 1.2.2 Shi-Tomasi corner detector
#### 1.2.3 FÃ¶rstner operator
#### 1.2.4 Difference of Gaussians

## 2. Descriptor: How we can describe those points using mathematics.
